			<h2>Evan Williams</h2>
			
			<h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
				<p>Williams grew up on a farm in Clarks, Nebraska, where he assisted with crop irrigation in summers. He attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln for a year-and-a-half, where he joined FarmHouse Fraternity, but eventually left to pursue his career. Williams is a pescetarian. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife, Sara, with whom he raises two children.</p>

			<h3>Career</h3>
				<h4>Early Career</h4>
					<p>After leaving school, Williams worked at various technology jobs and start-up firms in Florida, at Key West, and in Texas, at Dallas and Austin, before returning to his family farm in Nebraska. In 1996 Williams moved to Sebastopol, California in Sonoma County to work for the technology publishing company O'Reilly Media. He started at O'Reilly in a marketing position but eventually became an independent contractor writing computer code, which led to freelance opportunities with companies including Intel and Hewlett-Packard.</p>
				
				<h4>Evans Founded</h4>
					<ul>
						<li> Pyra Labs and Blogger </li>
						<li> Odeo </li>
						<li> Twitter </li>
						<li> Medium </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Williams also presented a TED Talk in 2009 which can be found <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/evan_williams_on_listening_to_twitter_users">here</a>.</p>

					<p>Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan co-founded Pyra Labs to make project management software. A note-taking feature spun off as Blogger, one of the first web applications for creating and managing weblogs. Williams invented the term "blogger" and was instrumental in the popularization of the term "blog". Pyra survived the departure of Hourihan and other employees, and was eventually acquired by Google on February 13, 2003.</p>
					<p>In 2003, Williams was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. In 2004, he was named one of PC Magazine's "People of the Year", along with Hourihan and Paul Bausch for their work on Blogger.</p>
				
				<h3>Odeo</h3>
					<p>Williams left Google in October 2004 to co-found Odeo, a podcasting company. In late 2006, Williams co-founded Obvious Corp. with Biz Stone and other former Odeo employees to acquire all previous properties from Odeo's former backers. In April 2007, Odeo was acquired by Sonic Mountain.</p>
					
				<h3>Twitter</h3>
					<p>Among Obvious Corp.'s projects was Twitter, a popular, free social networking and micro-blogging service. Twitter itself was spun out into a new company in April 2007, with Williams as co-founder, board member, and investor. In October 2008, Williams became CEO of Twitter, displacing Jack Dorsey who became chairman of the board.</p>
					<p>By February 2009, Compete.com ranked Twitter the third most-used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. As of February 2013, Twitter had 200 million registered users. It gets 300,000 new users a day and receives 180 million unique visitors a month. 75% of its traffic comes from outside of Twitter.com. <strong>On 4 October 2010, Williams stepped down from the CEO position, explaining "I’ll be completely focused on product strategy", and appointed Dick Costolo as his replacement.</strong></p>

					<p>Following the announcement of Twitter's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, the company was valued at between $14 billion and $20 billion. One media report anticipated that Williams, with a 30 to 35 percent stake in the company, would see his personal wealth grow from $2 billion to $8 billion in the wake of Twitter's stock flotation.</p>

					<p>According to the October 2013 Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, <em>his 12 percent stake in Twitter will be worth $1.2 billion when the company goes public.</em></p>
		
				<h3>Medium</h3>
					<p>On September 25, 2012, Williams and Stone created a publishing platform called Medium (at Medium.com). It was initially available only to early adopters, but was opened to the public in 2013. On April 5, 2013, Williams and Stone announced that they would be unwinding Obvious Corp as they focused on individual startups.</p>

				<h3>XOXO Festival</h3>
					<p>Williams presented at the 2013 XOXO Festival in Portland, Oregon, and explained his understanding of Internet commerce. During his XOXO session, Williams also likened the Internet to "a lot of other major technological revolutions that have taken place in the history of the world," such as agriculture, and asserted that the Internet is not a utopia.</p>

				<h3>Twitter vs. Instagram</h3>
					<p>Yesterday, Instagram announced it has 300 million monthly active users. The news drew immediate comparisons between the photo-sharing app, which sold to Facebook for $1 billion in 2012, and Twitter, a $24 billion publicly traded company which has 284 million users. CNNMoney even argued that Twitter should sell itself.</p>
					<p>I asked Evan Williams, Twitter co-founder and board member, what he thought of the news. His answer? User count is the wrong metric to focus on.</p>
					<p>In his words:</p>
					<p>“It’s a question of breadth versus depth. Why is users the only thing we talk about? The crazy thing: Facebook has done an amazing job of establishing that as the metric for Wall Street. No one ever talks about, ‘What is a [monthly active user]?’ I believe it’s the case that if you use Facebook Connect—if you use an app that you logged into with Facebook Connect—you’re considered a Facebook user whether or not you ever launched the Facebook app or went to Facebook.com. So what does that mean? It’s become so abstract to be meaningless. Something you did caused some data in their servers to be recorded for the month. So I think we’re on the wrong path.</p>
					<p>If you think about the impact Twitter has on the world versus Instagram, it’s pretty significant. It’s at least apples to oranges. Twitter is what we wanted it to be. It’s this realtime information network where everything in the world that happens on Twitter—important stuff breaks on Twitter and world leaders have conversations on Twitter. If that’s happening, <strong>I frankly don’t give a shit if Instagram has more people looking at pretty pictures</strong>.”</p>
					<p>I noted that Wall Street certainly cares about other things. Williams said he isn’t authorized to comment on anything financial, but countered that Twitter’s monetization has been going very well. “Twitter makes a hell of a lot more money than Instagram, if that’s what Wall Street cares about,” he said.</p>
					<p>Regarding Facebook’s method for counting users, Williams is correct. According to an SEC filing, Facebook’s definition of an active user includes anyone who “took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook.” So even if you don’t go to Facebook for a month, you count as a monthly active user if you use an app which you have signed up for with your Facebook account and shared something.</p>
					<p>To that end, Twitter is opening up its own definition of its user base. Last month Twitter CEO Dick Costolo revealed that content posted to Twitter actually reaches 500 million people each month when you take into account anyone who has seen a Tweet embedded in a webpage or another app. The takeaway? When it comes to the horse race for users, Costolo doesn’t give a…well, you know.</p>
